# Project 1: Bathroom Finder

## Description of Application

A website that finds and displays bathrooms near the user (or near an address that the user inputs) using REST APIS. 

The the application returns the five bathrooms nearest the user's current location or, alternately, an address the user inputs. The results are populated onto a map and into a scrollable list below the map. The list elements provide the user with each bathroom's name, address, if it is unisex, and its distance from the user or the address the user searched for. Also included with each bathroom on the list is a button for directions, which directs the user to GoogleMaps and imports the location and destination information. 

## User Story

AS A mobile person who likes to leave the house,\
I WANT to have the ability to find public bathrooms near me,\
SO THAT I know where to go when I need to go.
